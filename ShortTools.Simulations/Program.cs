            so, what do i need to do is first make the land ig.
            to do this, i am probably going to just use perlin noise with a modifier
            
            acutally i dont think i wanna do land first, i wanna make plants
            creatures eat plants and their fruit. The plants reproduce via seeds which either move by them selves or are eaten.

            Alleles include:
            
            Growth Amount
            
            - Fruit Density
            - Fruit Growth Speed
            - Fruit Nutrience
            - Fruit Lifespan
            - Fruit Taste

            // fruits have seeds and these seeds are bigger if the tree is bigger. I am going to assume that all trees produce fruits to reproduce

            // different tastes will attract different creatures.



            - Tree Height
            - Tree Growth Speed
            - Tree Width
            - Tree Branch Length
            - Tree Root Length

            // each of these affect size, so if they are bigger, then they use more energy, and the seeds are bigger. Some animals wont eat seeds that are too big so they 
            // will get left on the ground next to where they dropped, causing them to die.
            
            // if it is large and grows fast then it will use lots of energy, so it will need larger surface areas.


            - Colour 

            // Different colours will attract different creatures more.
